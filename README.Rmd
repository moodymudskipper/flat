# flat

{flat} makes your package into a script you can source to recreate it, this allows you to
email a flat file when emailing a compressed file is problematic.

It has a single function `flat::flatten_package()` that takes a package folder
(defaults to current folder) and an output file (defaults to printing to console).

{flat} is not needed on the recipient machine.

We ignore :

- hidden `.Rproj.user*` files
- git files
- binary files
- files under man/ (we assume they can be rebuilt with roxygen)
- README.md (we assume it can be rebuilt from a README.Rmd)
- .Rhistory
- testthat snapshots

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
devtools::install("moodymudskipper/flat")
```

## Example

```{r}
flat::flatten_package()
```
